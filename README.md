# MyZenjectTest
My Zenject Test - Use case creating mods (or mocking implementations) of an embedded package script

## Requirements
- Zenject 9.2.0
- Unity 2021.3.5f1

## TODO

- Add sample usage of the other pattern (Signals, signal suscribers and signal firing, instead of injecting Object instances that implement Interfaces. In theory firing and suscribing to a signal doesn't require to know anything but the signal fingerprint).
